  # via ARel predicate methods on Symbols: :name.matches, etc):

  # NOTE: Not recommended. Learn the new DSL. Use it. Love it.

  # Alias an existing predicate to a new name. Use the non-grouped
  # name -- the any/all variants will also be created. For example,
  # to alias the standard "lt" predicate to "less_than", and gain
  # "less_than_any" and "less_than_all" as well:
  #
  # config.alias_predicate :less_than, :lt
